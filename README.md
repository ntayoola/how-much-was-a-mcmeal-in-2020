# 🍟 McDonald’s Global Prices (2020)

This project explores the cost of a McDonald’s combo meal ("McMeal") in cities around the world using data from **Numbeo’s 2020 cost-of-living dataset**.

I analyzed over 100 cities globally to visualize global price differences, compare U.S. averages to the rest of the world, and break down affordability across regions.
